# Tom Awesome Little Language Compiler

A little bytecode language, based on a LIFO stack, all in plain C. Well, this is technically only the compiler, but you could write anything out of it!

## Installation

Just clone the repo, as usual and run:

```
make
```

This will create the compiler, and you are good to go.

## Usage

Create a `.tll` file, and follow the syntax rules, which I will write some day. Or you could try to compile the demo files!

Once you have your pretty `.tll` file, you just compile it using the executable inside the `bin` folder, like so:

```
./bin/tall my_awesome_file.tll
```

Right now is more of a side personal project, but if you find something interesting to add or a bug fix that I missed out, open an issue or submit a PR!
